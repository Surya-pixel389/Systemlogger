#What does my project do?#
This project utilises the Java language, which I created to monitor RAM usage, Disk usage, and CPU usage. I have provided the time stamp, which can be helpful, so it can show the date, month and time when this program was executed.

#What class and interface did I use?#
⦁	ManagementFactory – Connects to the JVM’s management interface.
⦁	OperatingSystemMXBean (from com.sun.management) – Gives access to advanced metrics like RAM and CPU usage.
⦁	File – Helps calculate disk space.
⦁	LocalDateTime & DateTimeFormatter – Formats the current time for clean, readable logs.

#Amazing thing about it -#
⦁	Modular design: Each resource has its method for clean code and easy reuse.
⦁	Error handling: Every method includes exception handling to avoid crashes and provide helpful error messages.
⦁	Timestamped logs: Know exactly when the data was captured.
⦁	Personal challenge: Built to sharpen Java skills and explore system-level programming.

#How to run it #
Just compile the main file and run it.
